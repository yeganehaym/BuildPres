Envato WordPress Theme Updater
==============================

WordPress library to enable automatic updates in the theme based on [Envato WordPress Toolkit Library](https://github.com/envato/envato-wordpress-toolkit-library) and [pixelentity PHP class](http://themeforest.net/forums/thread/simple-theme-update-class-using-envato-api/73278).

### Installation & Use

Download this repo to your theme, then add

```php
load_template( trailingslashit( get_template_directory() ) . 'wp-theme-upgrader/envato-wp-theme-updater.php' );
Envato_WP_Theme_Updater::init( $username, $apikey, $author );
```

to your `functions.php` where

```php
$username = Buyer Username
$apikey   = Buyer API Key
$author   = Your Author Name (as defined in your themes style.css)
```

The first 2 parameters should be set by the buyer somehow, like in your theme options page.
`$author` variable can be a single name, like "Pixelentity" or an array of strings. If not set,
all themes purchased by the user on ThemeForest (even if by different authors) can be updated.

### Authors

* [Envato](https://github.com/envato/envato-wordpress-toolkit-library)
